The !-RestFixtureWithSeq-! fixture records the interaction between the fixture client code and the system under test and generates a UML
sequence diagram. The fixture records the following methods:

* GET/PUT/DELETE: the call produces a simple activation against the resource represented as an object. the activation is synchronous and the result of the get operation call is returned to the caller
* POST: the call produces an activation against the resource object and the result (the status code and the ID extracted from the location header) passed to the client.
* comment: the call produces a comment string
 
The diagrams are natively generated in SVG format but can be also rendered in GIF or PNG.
If the diagram is generated in GIF or PNG it can be included in the test page via !-!img-! wiki command. This will succeed only if the images are stored in a location of the filesystem reachable by the fitnesse server.
If the diagram is stored in SVG format, it can be rendered using the included !-!svg-! symbol (see not below).

Sequence diagram events are recorded after the fixture method execution and the file stored after the table completes. So a new version of the diagram is generated *after* a fixture is run.

!*> Including SVG diagrams
It can be done via !-!svg-! symbol. To include the symbol the !-RestFixture.jar-! needs to be included in the !-FitNesse-! server classpath and the symbol needs to be registered in the plugins.properties file.
 * Add to the FITNESSE_HOME/plugins.properties (or create the file if it doen't exist) the following line: 
'''!-SymbolTypes-!=smartrics.rest.fitnesse.fixture.!-SvgImage-!'''
 * Add !-!svg-! to the beginning of a wiki page line followed by the path to the svg file and optionally by a rendering modifier. 
 * The path needs to be relative to the FitNesseRoot directory and as a child of the /files directory. For example if the 
file is stored in $FitNesseRoot/files/mysequencediagrams/picture.svg, then you can reference the file by providing 
'''!-!svg /files/mysequencediagrams/picture.svg mode-!'''
 * optionally add a rendering mode: '''inline''', '''object''', '''iframe''', '''embed''', '''anchor''', '''img'''. The modifier will determine what html tag is used to reference the file. '''inline''' will in fact inline the whole file using the &lt;svg> tag.
*!

!3 Usage
The filename for the diagram is the second parameter of the fixture, optionally followed by a list of additional attributes that determine how the SVG is generated. 

The filename extension determins the format of the sequence diagram image. Accepted extensions are: svg, gif, png

For example 

!-| smartrics.rest.fitnesse.fixture.RestFixtureWithSeq | host | /path/to/file.gif viewBox="0 0 500 500" width="400" height="500" | -!

Use width and height to determine the final dimensions of the output image and viewBox to further restrict the visible part of the image

In the example, a gif file is generated and the viewBox="0 0 500 500" width="400" height="500" are included in the &lt;svg> root tag.

By default files are generated in the directory ''FITNESSE_ROOT/files/restfixture''. Failure on creating/accessing the directory or storing a file in it should not break
the test. Although a stack trace is shown in standard error (see fixture output).

!**> note on file names with spaces
Use double quotes around the filename if the path contains spaces
*!

To override the default directory, use the config property ''restfixture.graphs.dir'' to the destination directory of the generated sequence diagrams. The default value is
''!-FitNesseRoot-!/files/restfixture''. 

For files to be included in the test pages, they need to be under ''FITNESSE_ROOT/files''.

|PUT    | /resources/%id1% | 200 | | |

!img files/restfixture/SequenceDiagDelete.png

|DELETE    | /resources/%id1% | 204 | | |

!3 Embedding an image
It's possible to embed a picture in the fixture itself. The picture embedded is the sequence generated to date
|!-smartrics.rest.fitnesse.fixture.RestFixtureWithSeq-!|http://${jettyHost}:${jettyPort}|!-SequenceDiagForEmbed.png viewBox="0 0 350 500" width="350" height="500" -!|
|setBody|<resource><name>test post</name><data>some data</data></resource>|
|POST   | /resources/ | 201 | | |
|let    | id1 | header | Location:/resources/(.+) | |
|embed  | viewBox="0 0 200 200" width="200" height="200" |
|GET    | /resources/%id1% | 200 | | |
|comment| created resource id=%id1% |
|POST   | /resources/ | 201 | | |

This is the picture generated by the fixture above.
!img files/restfixture/SequenceDiagForEmbed.png

Note:
 * embed does not generate any file in the filesystem and that the output is inlined either via &lt;SVG> or via &lt;IMG> tags (the latter with a base64 encoded string)
 * attributes can be specified in the embed row, for example !-''| embed | viewBox="0 0 200 200" width="200" height="200" |''-!
