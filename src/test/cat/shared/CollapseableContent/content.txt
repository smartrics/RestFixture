!3 Collapseable content

In the interest of readability, cells with large content can be rendered with a toggle on/off button.
The minimum length in characters of the cell, in order to enable the toggle button, is specified with the property

restfixture.display.toggle.for.cells.larger.than

If the value of the property is negative the toggle button will not be rendered.

Currently only large HTTP response content cells (if the actual value is displayed) are enabled for toggling.
