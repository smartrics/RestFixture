!3 GET

Get an existing resource should return the resource. There's a pre loaded resource in !-smartrics.rest.text.fitnesse.fixture.ResourcesServlet-!.

!**** Notes
A GET request is performed on the resource whose URI is specified in the second cell.
The following cell indicate:
1) the expected return HTTP code,
2) a subset of headers - regular expressions are allowed
3) a list of XPaths to be executed in the body. Each XPath is run and it suceedes only if the result of the execution
returns at least one node
